# Simple Web App for Typing Practice

This project is a simple web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app was created to help with typing numbers and special characters more efficiently.

## Motivation

I have always struggled with typing numbers and special characters, so I thought it would be a great idea to build a web app to help me practice and improve my typing skills.
